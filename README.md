# My Solutions of projects from CodeGym[EN version]-JavaRush[RU version] course (link in the description)
Course link: https://codegym.cc/ [EN] or https://javarush.ru/ [RU]

Here are the most complex and efficient projects of the mentioned course, in my opinion. Some of them deal with Java Enterprise frameworks and libraries, but others also use multithreading, swing, well-known design patterns and implementations of most interesting core data structures. Accordingly, here are video games, useful tools, examples of third-party software components deployment, and replications of existing structures that help deepen the understanding of Java language.

All projects have been developed under the terms of each particular task to pass validation requirements. Therefore, there is always a possibility to find out a better code structure or design solution that has gone unnoticed by course owners.
