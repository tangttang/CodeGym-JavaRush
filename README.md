CodeGym/JavaRush is an online Java programming course that is 80% based on practice. It offers 1200 practical tasks of increasing complexity that worth 500+ hours of Java programming experience. Practice also includes full-fledged projects that are the most challenging exercises and take place during the second half of the course.

Here are the most advanced projects of the mentioned course, in my opinion. Some of them deal with Java Enterprise frameworks and libraries, but others also use multithreading, swing, well-known design patterns and implementations of most interesting core data structures. Accordingly, here are video games, useful tools, examples of third-party software components usage, and replications of existing core structures that help deepen the understanding of Java language.

All projects have been developed under the terms of each particular corresponding task to pass validation requirements. Therefore, there is always a possibility to figure out a better code structure model or design solution that has gone unnoticed by course owners.
